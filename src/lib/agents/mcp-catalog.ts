/**
 * Curated, approved catalog of MCP integrations surfaced in Settings →
 * Integrations.
 *
 * Cabinet agents have no in-process tool loop — they run by spawning external
 * CLIs (Claude Code default; also Gemini/Codex). Those CLIs are the MCP
 * clients: they read their own config file and connect the MCP servers listed
 * there (including remote HTTP servers, whose OAuth the CLI drives itself).
 * So "connecting" an integration means registering a server entry into the
 * active provider's CLI config + (for token servers) stashing a credential in
 * `.cabinet.env`. See `mcp-config-writer.ts`.
 *
 * Trust tiers are honest: `official` is only claimed when the server is
 * vendor-published / present in the Official MCP Registry, and that claim is
 * *verified* at runtime by `mcp-registry-verify.ts` (never self-asserted in
 * the UI without verification). `cabinet` = a first-party server we build and
 * maintain (e.g. Discord) — first-party but NOT vendor-official, so it gets its
 * own label rather than borrowing "official" or hiding under "community".
 * `vendor` = published by the vendor themselves (their domain, their OAuth) but
 * NOT listed in the Official MCP Registry, so the `official` badge can't be
 * verified and would be a claim we can't back. Calling it `community` would be
 * the opposite lie. It gets its own honest label.
 *
 * Auth backends are deployment-aware (see `deployment-mode.ts`):
 *   - `cli-pkce`  — official remote HTTP server; the CLI performs PKCE
 *                   public-client OAuth. No secret ever ships in this OSS repo.
 *   - `user-app`  — fallback when a confidential client is unavoidable: the
 *                   user registers their own app; client id/secret live in
 *                   `.cabinet.env`, never written literally into CLI config.
 *   - `token`     — community stdio server authenticated by a pasted token.
 *   - `cabinet-broker` — reserved for the future cloud build (managed OAuth,
 *                   secret server-side). Not used by the local build.
